Koala is a JMRI compatible WiFi throttle 
that implements more realistic control and behavior of a steam locomotive.
It implements steam locomotive throttle, reverser and brakes.
Speed is based on
tractive effort, train resistance, grade, brake force, train mass and
the application of Newton's Laws.
Koala is targeted to those interested in micro-operation,
realistic operation of a locomotive and train.
