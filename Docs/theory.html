<h4>Going Faster With Less Steam</h4>

<img src=https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ItJK.gif width=400 align=right>

The reverser is the arm leading to the left in the image below that the engineer can control that as shown causes the mechanics of the valve gear to cause the drivers to move forward or in reverse.   In the diagram, the reverser is moved between the extremes.   However, it can be positioned anywhere between those extremes

<p>
At the extremes, the cylinder valves are open the maximum amount of time during the cylinder cycle (~80%), allowing steam from the steam chest next to the cylinders to enter the cylinder during that time.   

<p>
At slow speeds and low steam flow rates, the cylinder steam pressure may only be slightly lower than the steam chest pressure and the steam chest pressure only slightly lower than the boiler pressure.   But at higher flow rates those differences are greater and the boiler pressure will be lower as steam is consumed quickly and boiler water is replenished at a higher rate.

<p>
Moving the reverser only portion a of it's extreme position causes the the cylinder valve to close before the end of the cylinder cycle (i.e. cutoff), filling the cylinder at ~ steam chest pressure for only a portion of the cycle

<p>
As a volume filled with some gas at pressure expands, the pressure ideally drops inversely proportionally with the volume (PV = nRT).   In other words, pressure doesn't drop to zero when the cylinder valve is closed.

<p>

If the valve is closed at the halfway point during the cylinder cycle and the cycle allowed to continue, doubling the volume, the steam pressure ideally drops by half at the end of the cycle.   That means that during the later half cycle the average pressure is 75% of the max pressure.   And when considering that it was at full pressure for the first half of the cycle, the average steam pressure for the entire cycle is 87.5%.   In other words, using half as much steam only lowered the avg steam pressure by 12.5%

<p>
While this gain in efficiency is certainly helpful, the other aspect of using less steam, especially at speed, is that it provides time for steam to flow from the boiler into the steam chest, restoring pressure in the steam chest so that the maximum pressure at the beginning of each cylinder cycle is higher.

<p>
The combination of higher initial steam pressure and the relatively small loss in average pressure result in higher average force, allowing greater speed.

<p>
Knowing how to adjust the reverser as the locomotive gains speed, and avoiding slip, is challenging

<h4> Brakes: Air and Independent </h4>

The independent brake pressure on the loco directly controls the brake, unlike the auto/air brake.   The brake force increases as the independent brake pressure increases.      suggest you try using the independent brakes with REL-Q(uick), REL-S(low), LAP, APP-S and APP-Q.  Last columns in output.

<p>
Auto/air brakes are like DCC in that the brake line both provides the impetus of the brakes, pressurizing the air reservoir in each car as well as signaling when to apply and release brakes.

The locomotive has air pumps and tanks
to supply air to brake line connecting each car of the train.
Each car has a reservoir, triple valve and brake cylinders.
Air from the brake line supplies air to the reservoirs of each car.
Normal operation is to pressurize the brake line and reservoirs to 90 lb.

<p>
When the triple valve detects a drop in brake line pressure,
a difference in pressure between the reservoir and brake line,
it allows air from the reservoir to slow into the brake cylinder
which applies force the brakes contacting the wheels.
The triple valve stops the flow of air into the brake cylinder
when the reservoir pressure equals the brake line pressure.
The brake cylinder pressure is limited to 25(?) psi.

<p>
As soon as the triple detects an increase in brake line pressure,
it releases the air from the brake cylinders.
Air will flow from the brake line into the reservoirs
when the brake line pressure exceeds the reservoir pressure.

<p>
Various brake lever setting control the rate of air into or
released from the brake line.
Setting the brakes to LAP, maintains the brake line and brake line pressure.    
It takes time for a change in brake line pressure to propagate
down the length of a train.

<p>
A quick reduction in brake pressure will affect
the cars closest to the locomotive causing them to apply their brakes
long before cars at the end of the train see a change in pressure.
The various service settings, SVC1, SVC2
allow a gradual reduction in pressure and
braking to occur more evenly from every car in the train.

<p>
After the release of brakes,
air is needed to replenish the reservoirs
allowing additional brake applications
A single application of brakes
may drop the brake line pressure from 90 to 65 PSI.
A subsequent application after releasing the brakes
and without much time to replenish the reservoirs
may further reduce  reservoir pressure to 45 psi.
The number of brake applications is therefore limited.

The plot illustrates the brake line pressure (violet),
braking force (red) which is negative and
the air brake level setting (magenta)

<p>
The brake line pressure starts at zero but rapidly increases to 90 PSI.
The application of SVC1 causes a decrease in brake line pressure and
corresponding increase in braking force.
Moving the brake lever to LAP maintains both pressures.
Moving the lever to REL cause the braking force
to immediately drop to zero and allows the brake line pressure to increase.

<p>
The second brake application is EMER
which causes a rapid decrease in brake line pressure and
increase in braking force until is maxes out at a value of 10.

<p>
The third application of brakes sequences through SVC1, SVC2 and SVC3,
each increasing the rate of brake line pressure reduction and
the increase in braking force, also maxing out.
The brake line pressure was allowed to drop unnecessarily low.
Setting the brake lever to REL allows it to increase back to 90 PSI.

<p>
Braking a train requires anticipating the need for and amount of braking.
